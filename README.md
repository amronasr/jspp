C++ has a new standard called C++0x ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x), [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html)) that includes many interesting features such as Lambda, For Each, List Initialization ... Those features are so powerful that they allow to write C++ as if it was Javascript.

The goal of this project is to transform C++ into Javascript. We want to be able to copy & paste Javascript into C++ and be able to run it. While this is not 100% feasible, the result is quite amazing.

**This is only a prototype**. In about 600 lines of code we manage to make the core of the Javascript language.
